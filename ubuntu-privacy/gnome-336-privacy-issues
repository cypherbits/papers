Privacy issues impacting GNOME (used in Ubuntu 20.04 and other distributions):

Use cases:

1. User cannot disable thumbnails generation:
- A user can disable thumbnail generation for Files (Nautilus) only.
- If you open an image with EyeOfGnome a thumbnail will be generated. No way to disable this in the app itself. (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/eog/-/issues/130)
- Thumbnails will still be generated on the open, save or select dialogs. For example, saving an image with Firefox will always generate a thumbnail.
- This cannot be disabled easily in the Control Center. But there is a Dconf command to disable all thumbnail generation (dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/thumbnailers/disable-all true)
- TODO: investigate how old thumbnails are cleaned / deleted.

2. Sometimes, the ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/notifications file contains old notifications which may contain sensitive information.

3. Too much metadata collection, gvfs-metadata daemon (files on ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata/)
- There is no guide anywhere to disable this metadata collection easily.
- This keeps metadata of many files you work with even if they are just temporal files.
- There is no clear algorithm to clean this metadata: (see this comment and the issue https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/-/issues/117#note_900090)
- Tor Browser is affected by this: metadata on sites you visit is written on this files.
- Veracrypt is affected too.
